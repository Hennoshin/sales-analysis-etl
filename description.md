## Problem Background
Revenue and profit is usually considered as the main driving force and one of the primary objectives for a company. Maximizing revenue and profit is therefore desirable. One of the ways this can be achieved is by increasing sales of products. To achieve increase in sales, sales analysis  is required. Sales analysis can be done to identify product and market trends. Not only that, sales analysis can also be used to perform analysis on the customer which can be used as a basis for targeted marketing, which can lead to more sales opportunities in the future. Because of that, sales analysis will be performed on the sales data to improve the revenue and profit in the future.
